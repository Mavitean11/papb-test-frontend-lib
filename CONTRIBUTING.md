[![contributions welcome](https://badgen.net/badge/contributions/welcome/green)](https://github.com/papb/papb-test-frontend-lib/issues)

Every contribution is welcome. Note that "solving bugs" is not the only form of contribution:

* Opening issues is also a good form of contributing
* Help improving documentation is also a good contribution
* Creating more tests is a good contribution, especially failing tests for open issues

# General

When opening issues or pull requests, text is formatted automatically using Markdown. [Learn more about Markdown writing in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github) - it is easy, and your text will be well formatted and easy to read!

This library is MIT Licensed. By contributing to this library, you agree that your contributions are also MIT Licensed to it.

# Issues

If you're informing a bug, please describe it in a way that developers can easily **understand** and **reproduce** what is going on. Please include a [MVCE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

When you include code, please make sure it is well formatted. Use the *preview tab* to check before submitting your issue. [Learn more about Markdown writing in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/articles/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github).

If you're opening a feature request (i.e., an enhancement), please describe exactly what you're thinking and why it would be useful.

For both cases (either bug or feature request), if you are willing to try to fix it (or implement it), pull requests are super welcome, but certainly not mandatory. If you can't fix it but can at least open a pull request with a failing test, that also helps immensely.

# Pull requests

A pull request is a request you make to the library to include some changes you propose into it ("pulling" your changes). To open a pull request, you must *fork* this repository. Learn more about forks [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-forks) and [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo).

If there is anything that you would like to change in this repository, please open a pull request! You don't have to be an expert. Anyone is welcome to do it.

In the description of your pull request, please explain what is it doing and why. If you can link to an existing issue, that is great too.

## Development setup

You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

To open a pull request, you probably want to make the changes and test them locally. After forking, clone your repository with `git clone` to your local machine and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. You can run the tests with `npm test`.

## Committing

Feel free to make several commits in your fork, and don't worry about their names. When your PR is merged, everything will be squashed to a single commit and the maintainers will choose the best commit message. You will retain authorship of the changes, of course.
