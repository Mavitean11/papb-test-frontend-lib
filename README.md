# papb-test-frontend-lib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/papb/papb-test-frontend-lib.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/papb/papb-test-frontend-lib)

This is a <s>useless</s> library for the front-end that I develop to experiment with the various Javascript tools available around. The goals:

* To easily build dists for browsers (perhaps using [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify))?
* To setup automated releases (perhaps using [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release))?
* To make front-end testing (perhaps using [cypress](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress))?
* To generate and display good documentation in GitHub Pages and/or with [now](https://github.com/zeit/now-cli)
* To use [greenkeeper](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper) and perhaps other good GitHub bots
* To enforce proper linting (using [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint))
* Use TypeScript or at least the so-called "TypeScript typings"

This is a work in progress.
